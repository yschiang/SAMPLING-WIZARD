## 0. Core Philosophy

The Sampling Wizard is a **decision-support system**, not a form.
It guides Process Engineers through intent, constraints, and risk trade-offs.

---

## 1. Global UX Invariants

- State must always be visible.
- Decisions must feel owned by the user.
- Irreversible actions require preview + confirmation.

---

## 2. Step Semantics

### Step 1 – Technology
Defines wafer geometry and physical constraints.

### Step 2 – Process Context
Defines measurement intent and yield risk.

### Step 3 – Tool Selection
Constrains solution space by tool capability.

### Step 4 – Sampling Strategy
Selects mathematical hypothesis of defect distribution.

### Step 5 – Preview & Score
Validates effectiveness, risk, and trade-offs.

### Step 6 – Final Recipe
Commits executable artifact with clear ownership.

## 3. UX Quality Bar

A UI is acceptable only if users understand:
- why a choice is made
- what risk remains
- what happens after commit
