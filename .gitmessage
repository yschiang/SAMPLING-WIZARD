# <type>(<role>): <short milestone-level summary>
#
# Context:
# - Why this change exists (architectural intent or business need)
#
# Scope:
# - What is included / excluded
# - Specific components affected
#
# Invariants:
# - Which architectural guards are preserved
# - Which boundaries are maintained (e.g. L4 no-mutation, OpenAPI frozen)
#
# Notes:
# - No OpenAPI changes
# - No FE contract impact
# - Other relevant information
#
# --- ALLOWED ROLES ---
# arch   = Architecture, contracts, baselines, invariants
# be     = Backend implementation (Claude BE agent)  
# fe     = Frontend implementation (Gemini)
# audit  = Audit / verification only
#
# --- ALLOWED TYPES ---
# feat     = New capability / milestone
# fix      = Bug fix (no scope expansion)
# refactor = Internal restructure (no behavior change)  
# docs     = Documentation only
# test     = Tests only (incl. invariant guards)
# chore    = Tooling, config, CI, repo hygiene
#
# --- RULES ---
# - One PR = One commit = One milestone
# - Do not mix FE / BE / ARCH concerns in one commit
# - Document invariant preservation for arch/be changes
# - Log v1 proposals for missing features, don't patch silently
# - NO Claude Code attribution lines in commit messages
#
# --- EXAMPLES ---
# feat(be): implement L3 CENTER_EDGE deterministic strategy
# feat(fe): M4 wizard step navigation and state management  
# fix(be): L5 coordinate conversion edge case handling
# docs(arch): add PR architecture invariant checklist
# test(be): L4 no-mutation guard validation
# chore(arch): update CI workflow for contract validation
